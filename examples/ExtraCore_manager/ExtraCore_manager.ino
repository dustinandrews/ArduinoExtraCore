//This Manager example is meant to show the ways you can interact with a remote.
//You can and should adapt it to your scenario.
//It's best not to use the remote for timing critical applications.
//Indeed you should assume messages will sometimes be dropped and the remote state
//will be out of sync at times.
//Remote readings will only come in 100 times a second. You should assume they can
//also get stale.
